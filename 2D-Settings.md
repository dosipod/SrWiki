## Introduction

In order to accommodate 2D effects we have modified how Segment settings are used and added 2D Matrix and panel variables on the LED settings page.
Note: Currently only working in dev. Segment settings currently in SEGMENT2DV2 Branch of dev. You are invited to test this and give feedback on [Beta testing discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/700041398778331156/700701772838207640)
