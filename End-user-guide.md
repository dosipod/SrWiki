## Introduction

What if you have all the hardware in place but are new to WLED. For instance you asked a tech person to make it for you or bought it completely ready or got this as a gift. How to find out how everything works? There is a lot of documentation available but in general they zoom in into the technical details and only partly addresses how to use it.
This page addresses this and gives an overview for end users. Where possible linking to (parts of) existing content, like a section on a webpage or a part of a YouTube movie.
This is work in progress and also never finished, as new functionality and also new instructions will continue to emerge.

## Fork
As WLED Sound Reactive is a fork of WLED, a general End User Guide can be found [here](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/End-user-guide).

On this page Sound Reactive specific information can be found (in the near future)
